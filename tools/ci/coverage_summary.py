"""Render coverage.py JSON as a compact Markdown table for the CI run summary.

Modes (by number of report arguments):
  1 report   -> single "Coverage" column (e.g. JAX MaxText E2E).
  2+ reports -> "Unit" vs "Unit+E2E". The 1st is unit; the rest are E2E reports,
                merged per module by max covered lines (avoids double-counting
                torch's near-disjoint megatron/torchtitan E2E).

Layout: top-level groups are bold rows sorted by coverage; core/backends also
get indented per-area detail rows. The headline percentage gets a tier emoji
(_TIER_THRESHOLDS) and a curated "Notes" column flags widely-shared infra or a
known low-coverage cause (NOTES) -- both are reading aids, not quality gates.

What counts toward a total vs. what gets its own row are deliberately
decoupled decisions -- see classify().

Single-report mode hides untouched modules and totals only the executed ones,
so a partial run (e.g. MaxText E2E) isn't diluted by code it can't reach; the
two-report comparison keeps the full denominator.
