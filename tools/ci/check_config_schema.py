"""Fail CI when a Primus YAML sets a backend key upstream no longer defines.

Every backend adapter accepts unknown keys silently, so a field that upstream
renamed or moved keeps parsing while doing nothing. Prints the drift as Markdown
for `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`:

    python tools/ci/check_config_schema.py --warn-only >> "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY"

A key upstream looks to have merely renamed gets a table and a row of its own:
that is a fix someone applies one key at a time. The rest share a table where a
row is a set of configs, because dozens of dead keys are usually one preset's
worth of rot, and repeating the same three long paths for each of them buries
the part a reader has to act on.

TorchTitan, MaxText and Megatron each have their schema read from their own
`third_party/` submodule. A backend whose submodule is not checked out has
nothing to compare against and is skipped, which exits non-zero even under
`--warn-only`: a checkout that fetches only some of them drops that part of the
check, and a check that did not run must not look like one that passed.

A config that cannot be loaded (broken `extends:` path, unparseable YAML) fails
the check just like drift does -- an unchecked config must never be counted as a
passing one. `--warn-only` suppresses both.

Misplaced model-scoped keys get their own table. Such a key is not unknown --
some Primus config class does declare it -- but that class is built for one
model only, so setting the key on any other model is the same silent no-op.
