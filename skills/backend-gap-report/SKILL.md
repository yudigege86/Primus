description: Compare a Primus backend against an upstream repository or reference, verify git state, dependencies, directory changes, and integration coupling, then generate comparison reports, dashboard metadata, and a deployable dashboard index. Also owns the shared Primus engineering dashboard under `tools/backend_gap_report/`, which surfaces both backend-gap reports and weekly engineering reports as first-class sections. Use when comparing TorchTitan, Megatron, or other Primus backends with upstream branches, tags, or releases, or when integrating weekly engineering reports into the shared dashboard.

# Backend Gap Report & Shared Dashboard

Use this skill when the user asks to compare a Primus backend with upstream code and wants stable deliverables instead of ad hoc notes, **or** when integrating a different content type (e.g. weekly engineering reports) into the shared Primus engineering dashboard that lives under `tools/backend_gap_report/`.

## Default Outputs

Unless the user explicitly asks otherwise, produce:

- detailed report: `docs/backend-gap/reports/<backend>/<target>/report.md`
- one-page summary: `docs/backend-gap/reports/<backend>/<target>/summary.md`
- publish-time PDF copies of both reports with the same basename
- Dashboard metadata: `docs/backend-gap/dashboard-data/reports/<backend>-<target>.json`
- Refreshed dashboard index: `docs/backend-gap/dashboard-data/index.json`
  (generated build artifact, not committed)

If legacy report files already exist, update them in place instead of renaming them. For new report series, keep the default artifact names unsuffixed. Only add a language suffix when a non-default variant coexists or when a legacy file pattern already established one.

## Required Inputs

Resolve these inputs before writing:

1. `backend`
2. Local source path or submodule path
3. Upstream repository and comparison ref (`main`, tag, release commit, etc.)
4. Authoritative dependency evidence files
5. Primus integration directories for that backend

If any of these are ambiguous, ask the user before proceeding.

## Workflow

### 1. Establish the Comparison Baseline

Verify:

- local version or pinned commit
- upstream target commit
- commit dates
- commit gap
- merge-base relation
- diff size

Use git facts from the actual local checkout. If the upstream ref might be stale, fetch it first.

### 2. Verify Dependency Facts

Prefer authoritative sources in this order:

1. package metadata such as `pyproject.toml`
2. runtime or CI requirements files
3. workflow install commands
4. release notes or release docs
5. README install examples

Do not treat README examples as stronger evidence than workflow or package metadata.

### 3. Verify Directory and Capability Changes

Check the actual tree or diffs for areas such as:

- model directories
- distributed runtime
- experiments
- components
- docs
- workflows
- tests

Only write facts you can confirm from the repository state.

### 4. Verify Primus Coupling

Identify direct Primus dependencies on upstream internal paths, such as:

- imports from backend internals
- monkey patches
- trainer or adapter coupling
- config object dependencies

If the report discusses upgrade cost or blast radius, ground it in these concrete coupling points.

### 5. Write the Reports

Default report set:

- detailed comparison report
- one-page summary

When continuing an existing report series, preserve the established naming pattern and structure. Keep summary and detailed versions factually consistent.

### 6. Export PDFs

Use the shared stylesheet at `tools/backend_gap_report/templates/pdf-report.css`.

Preferred command pattern:

```bash
pandoc "docs/backend-gap/reports/<backend>/<target>/<report>.md" --from gfm --standalone \
  --css "tools/backend_gap_report/templates/pdf-report.css" \
  --metadata pagetitle="<title>" \
  --pdf-engine=weasyprint \
  -o "/tmp/backend-gap-pdf/<backend>/<target>/<report>.pdf"
```

Use `pagetitle`, not `title`, to avoid duplicate visible titles in the PDF.

Note:

- Markdown reports are the tracked source artifacts in the repository.
- PDF files are generated for publishing and are not tracked in the repository.

### 7. Emit Dashboard Metadata

Create a metadata JSON file under `docs/backend-gap/dashboard-data/reports/`.

The metadata must:

- be relative to the `docs/` root
- reference publish artifact paths that can be generated
- map to markdown source files that exist in the repo
- include backend identity, refs, stats, highlights, and artifact links
- include `dashboard_summary` with concise homepage-ready facts when the report has enough evidence

Use the schema and examples in [reference.md](reference.md) and [examples.md](examples.md).

### 8. Refresh the Dashboard Index

Run:

```bash
python3 tools/backend_gap_report/build_dashboard_index.py
```

This validates metadata files and rewrites `docs/backend-gap/dashboard-data/index.json`.
That index is a generated build artifact — do not commit it; commit only the
per-report metadata under `dashboard-data/reports/`.

### 8.5 Build the Standalone Site Bundle

For publishing or local preview, build the standalone dashboard bundle from the site templates plus generated artifacts:

```bash
python3 tools/backend_gap_report/build_site_bundle.py --output-dir /tmp/backend-gap-site
```

This assembles a publishable site root from:

- `tools/backend_gap_report/site/`
- `docs/backend-gap/dashboard-data/`
- `docs/backend-gap/reports/`

This command rebuilds dashboard index, generates PDF files from markdown report sources, builds the standalone bundle, and validates bundle integrity in one run.

### 9. Final Verification

Before finishing:

- verify the Markdown files exist
- verify the metadata JSON exists
- run the site bundle build successfully
- check lints for edited files when applicable

## Update Semantics

- For the same `backend` + `target`, update the existing files in place.
- Re-running the same report series should overwrite or refresh:
  - `report.md`
  - `summary.md`
  - `docs/backend-gap/dashboard-data/reports/<backend>-<target>.json`
  - `docs/backend-gap/dashboard-data/index.json`
- PDF artifacts are regenerated during standalone site bundle build.
- Create new sibling paths only when the backend or target changes.
- Running the skill does not trigger background automation by itself; updates happen only when the agent is explicitly asked to run the workflow in a task.

## Output Rules

- Keep the default report set as the primary artifact set.
- Do not over-emphasize the default language in filenames, labels, or dashboard copy.
- Add language suffixes or labels only when needed to distinguish a non-default variant or preserve a legacy series.
- Keep facts synchronized across detailed and summary reports.
- Prefer concise factual wording over long explanations.
- Do not invent missing versions or release claims.
- If a file contains comments only, do not call it "empty".

## Dashboard Rules

- Dashboard source templates live under `tools/backend_gap_report/site/`.
- `docs/backend-gap/` stores generated data and report artifacts, not the site templates.
- The deployed site root is a generated standalone bundle.
- Dashboard source data lives under `docs/backend-gap/dashboard-data/reports/`.
- `docs/backend-gap/dashboard-data/index.json` is a generated build artifact —
  not hand-maintained and not committed (only the per-report metadata under
  `dashboard-data/reports/` is tracked).
- Artifact paths in metadata are relative to the standalone published site root.
- Backend deep-dive cards should render structured `dashboard_summary` fields when present. Do not make the frontend infer important conclusions from Markdown prose.

### Backend Dashboard Summary

When generating backend metadata, add a `dashboard_summary` object whenever the comparison has confirmed facts worth surfacing on the homepage:

- `headline`: one sentence explaining why this backend comparison matters
- `recommendation`: concise action label such as `monitor`, `plan sync`, or `urgent sync`
- `why_it_matters`: 3-5 concise facts or risks
- `feature_deltas`: notable upstream capabilities added since the Primus pin
- `dependency_deltas`: dependency, runtime, CUDA, ROCm, or package-channel differences
- `integration_risks`: Primus-specific coupling points or upgrade risks

All `dashboard_summary` content must be derived from the same evidence used in the detailed report. Do not invent features, versions, or risks to make the dashboard look richer.

## Periodic Engineering Report Integration (Weekly + Monthly)

The shared dashboard under `tools/backend_gap_report/` surfaces two content
types from a single static site:

1. **Backend gap reports** — owned by this skill, stored under `docs/backend-gap/`.
2. **Periodic engineering reports** — the automated Primus reports, on a
   **weekly** cadence under `docs/weekly_reports/` and a **monthly** cadence
   under `docs/monthly_reports/`.

Weekly and monthly reports share one schema, one validation core
(`tools/backend_gap_report/periodic_reports.py`), and one combined dashboard
index, so the dashboard renders both through a single generic path — cadence is
just a data field. Routine report runs should update report data only and
should not redesign the dashboard.

### Periodic-report data plane

For each cadence directory (`weekly_reports` or `monthly_reports`):

- Per-report metadata: `docs/<cadence>/dashboard-data/reports/{report_id}.json`
- Per-cadence index: `docs/<cadence>/dashboard-data/index.json` (generated build
  artifact, not committed)
- The Markdown report lives at
  `docs/<cadence>/{report_id}-primus-{weekly|monthly}.md` and is not bundled
  into the published site — the dashboard links to the GitHub-rendered Markdown
  via `report_github_url` in each metadata file.
- `report_id` uses `YYYY-Www` (weekly, e.g. `2026-W17`) or `YYYY-MM` (monthly,
  e.g. `2026-06`).
- The combined `reports-data/index.json` consumed by the frontend is assembled
  at bundle-build time from both cadences; it is generated, not committed.
- A cadence directory that does not exist yet is treated as zero reports, so the
  monthly plane activates automatically once the first monthly report lands.

Required fields in each report metadata JSON (identical for both cadences):

- `report_id`, `content_type` (`weekly-report` or `monthly-report`), `title`
- `report_path`, `report_github_url`
- `time_window` (`timezone`, `start`, `end`)
- `generated_at`, `merged_pr_count`, `category_breakdown`
- `megatron_status`, `torchtitan_status`, `primus_turbo_status`
- `recommendations` (keys: `megatron`, `torchtitan`, `primus_turbo`)
- `key_findings` (non-empty list of short, factual strings)

### Index builders

Refresh a single cadence index directly:

```bash
python3 tools/backend_gap_report/build_weekly_reports_index.py
python3 tools/backend_gap_report/build_monthly_reports_index.py
```

Run the full site bundle (which assembles the combined index and validates every
plane) to publish:

```bash
python3 tools/backend_gap_report/build_site_bundle.py --output-dir /tmp/primus-dashboard-site
```

### Presentation rules for the shared dashboard

- The homepage leads with the latest engineering snapshot — the most recent
  report regardless of cadence (weekly or monthly).
- Cadence is surfaced as a small badge on the featured snapshot and on each
  archive card; the archive exposes a cadence filter only when more than one
  cadence is present.
- Backend gap reports appear as backend deep-dive cards, not as a separate
  top-level dashboard module or tab.
- Backend deep-dive cards are generated from backend metadata records and expand
  automatically when new backend reports are added.
- Backend cards prioritize `dashboard_summary` content: why it matters, new
  upstream capabilities, dependency shifts, integration risks, and PDF links.
- Keep interaction affordances earning their place: hide filters that do not yet
  vary (e.g. a single-cadence archive, or a backend filter for only a few cards).
- Visual style must remain calm, editorial, and presentation-ready: a system
  serif display paired with a native sans body and native mono for hard data
  (system fonts only, no web-font downloads — the dashboard must look identical
  on networks where third-party font CDNs are blocked), restrained motion (at
  most one reduced-motion-aware load reveal), and no emoji. Avoid generic AI
  aesthetics and maximalist effects.
- Card-internal layout must use container queries (not viewport media queries)
  so columns reflow by the card's own width, and long tokens must wrap
  (`overflow-wrap`) so they never overflow when zoomed.

### When to update the dashboard shell

- Data-only runs (standard case): update only report metadata under
  `docs/<cadence>/dashboard-data/` and the refreshed Markdown report.
  Do not modify shared tooling, site, or this skill.
- Shell updates are allowed only when there is a concrete structural gap
  (missing cadence support, a rendering bug, a schema evolution) or when the
  user explicitly requests a shell change.

## Data location

Backend-gap report data (the `docs/backend-gap/...` files this skill produces)
belongs to the same `dashboard-data` data plane as the weekly/monthly reports.
This skill only generates the files under that layout; the branch, commit, and
deploy orchestration are owned by the caller (the automation's Agent
Instructions), not this skill.
