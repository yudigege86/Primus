"""Tier 1 -- B. NIC / RDMA roll-call (per-port state + GIDs from sysfs).

Selector chain
==============

Many clusters expose more RDMA-capable ports in ``/sys/class/infiniband/``
than the training job will actually use. Common reasons:

* a separate front-end / management RoCE NIC that is physically present
  but admin-disabled (no SFP, BIOS port-disable, netdev down) -- typical
  ``state=DOWN phys_state=Disabled`` ports;
* a storage / control-plane RoCE NIC that is fully up but is reserved
  for sockets (it shows up in ``NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME`` rather than
  ``NCCL_IB_HCA``).

Failing the node on those ports is wrong: the operator already told
NCCL/RCCL not to use them, and the training job will run fine. So the
collector resolves a *training-NIC selector* and only enforces the hard
rules (state must be ACTIVE, phys_state must be LinkUp, RoCE v2 GID
present, ...) on the included subset. Excluded ports stay in
``ports`` for diagnostics and are summarised in ``info_issues``.

Selector precedence (highest first):

1. ``allowlist`` argument -- typically wired to ``--rdma-nic-allowlist``
   on the CLI. NCCL syntax (see :func:`_parse_nic_selector` below).
2. ``NCCL_IB_HCA`` env -- mirrors what NCCL/RCCL itself will use, so the
   smoke test and the training launch agree by construction.
3. ``phys_state in {Disabled, Sleep}`` heuristic -- ports in those
   administratively-down phys_states are intentionally not in use
   (admin-disabled at firmware/driver level, no SFP, BIOS-disabled, ...)
   and are auto-excluded. Crucially, real failure modes on a port that
   *is* intended to be used produce a different phys_state
   (``Polling``, ``LinkErrorRecovery``, ``LinkUp`` with ``state!=ACTIVE``,
   ...), so this heuristic does not mask cable / driver problems.
4. Fallback: every IB port must be ACTIVE / LinkUp (the strict rule).

Empty-set guard: if the resolved included set is empty (every port was
excluded by some combination of the above) but the host has at least
one IB port at all, that's still a node FAIL -- a node with zero
training NICs cannot participate in inter-node training.

    Accepts the full NCCL syntax:

    * Comma-separated entries of the form ``device[:port]``. ``port``
      is an integer; if omitted, the entry matches any port on the
      device.
    * Optional ``^`` prefix on the *whole* string makes it a denylist
      (every device matches except the listed ones).
    * Optional ``=`` prefix on an individual entry forces an exact
      device-name match (e.g. ``=mlx5`` matches device ``mlx5`` only,
      not ``mlx5_0``). Without ``=``, an entry is a *prefix* match,
      matching ``mlx5`` against ``mlx5_0`` / ``mlx5_1`` / ...

      it is normally auto-populated by the SM; an empty GID table on
      an ACTIVE IB port indicates a subnet-manager problem.

      have any valid GID" so we don't false-FAIL exotic configurations.
