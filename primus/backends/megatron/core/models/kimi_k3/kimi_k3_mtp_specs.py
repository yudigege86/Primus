"""Kimi K3 Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) block spec.

Wires Kimi K3 onto Megatron's upstream :class:`MultiTokenPredictionBlock`
-- per-depth ``eh_proj`` + a K3 decoder layer + RMSNorm -- exactly as
DeepSeek-V4 did at its P16 (``6c5875d``,
``deepseek_v4_mtp_specs.py::get_v4_mtp_block_spec``). The loss half is
upstream's :func:`process_mtp_loss`, called from
:meth:`KimiK3Model.forward`.

What the tech report actually specifies
--------------------------------------

* **One MTP layer.** Table 1: ``MTP Layers | 1 layer``. The released
  ``config.json`` ships ``num_nextn_predict_layers: 0`` and the released
  modelling code has no MTP module, so the release was *stripped*, not
  trained without one.
* **Its input is the final hidden state.** §4.1.4 (Draft Model
  Fine-Tuning) is the only prose about MTP: the EAGLE-3 draft's fusion
  matrix is initialised ``[0 0 I]`` "so that the fused representation
  coincides at initialization with the high-level feature h -- **the input
  on which the MTP layer was pre-trained**". The high-level feature is the
  output of the final AttnRes block, and §2.2 says "the final output layer
  then aggregates all N block representations" -- which is
  :class:`AttentionResidualHead`. So the MTP layer consumes the tensor the
  LM head consumes, after ``attn_res_head`` and after
  ``final_layernorm``. That is also precisely what upstream hands it
  (``gpt_model.py``), so no divergence is needed.
* **"an MTP layer that mirrors the structure of a backbone layer"**
  (§4.1.4). K3's backbone is heterogeneous, so *which* layer is a
  resolved ambiguity -- see :meth:`KimiK3TransformerConfig.mtp_layer_is_kda`.
  The default mirrors the **final** backbone layer, which §2.1 guarantees
  is a Gated MLA layer: "An additional Gated MLA layer is placed at the
  end of the backbone, ensuring that the final layer always performs
  global attention."

What the report does **not** specify, and what was chosen instead
-----------------------------------------------------------------

* **The loss weight.** ``mtp_loss_scaling_factor`` keeps upstream's /
  DeepSeek-V3's ``0.1``. A choice, not a reproduction.
* **Whether the MTP layer itself runs attention residuals.** It does
  **not**, and the argument is structural rather than aesthetic:

  1. AttnRes is defined (report Eq. 8-9) over the outputs of *preceding
     backbone layers* plus the token embedding. The MTP layer is not a
     member of that stack.
  2. The block representations have already been consumed --
     ``attn_res_head`` collapsed them into the very tensor the MTP layer
     receives. Re-attending over them would double-count.
  3. A single MTP layer has no cross-layer history of its own, so its
     mixers would softmax over one candidate. That is the identity, and
     it would leave ``2 * 2 * hidden`` parameters that can never receive a
     gradient -- permanently disarming
     ``test_every_parameter_receives_a_finite_gradient``, which is this
     project's cheapest detector of an unwired submodule.
  4. There is nothing to carry it in: ``_lower_res_out`` deliberately
     returns the bare ``[s, b, h]`` hidden state on the ``post_process``
     stage (``kimi_k3_block.py``), and neither
     :class:`MultiTokenPredictionBlock` nor
     :class:`MultiTokenPredictionLayer` has a slot for a second tensor.

  Mechanically this is the ``use_attn_residuals=False`` override on
  :class:`KimiK3Layer`. Without it the MTP layer would inherit
  ``config.attn_res_block_size``, compute ``num_blocks_in =
  ceil(layer_idx / block_size) > 0``, be handed no ``block_residual``, and
  trip the drift assert at ``kimi_k3_block.py`` on the first
  forward. That failure is loud, which is why this file's job is to make
  the *quiet* alternative -- appending a spurious ninth checkpoint --
  impossible.

Two upstream contracts this file exists to satisfy
--------------------------------------------------

* ``enorm`` / ``hnorm`` / ``layer_norm`` are invoked as **raw callables**,
  ``self.submodules.enorm(config=..., hidden_size=..., eps=...)``
  (``multi_token_prediction.py``), not through
  ``build_module``. So they must be the norm *class* from the provider and
  **not** the ``ModuleSpec(module=...)`` wrapper that
  ``kimi_k3_layer_specs._build_norm_spec`` returns for the decoder tree.
* The inner layer's ``self_attention`` spec must declare
  ``params['attn_mask_type']`` in
  ``{padding, causal, no_mask, padding_causal}``
  (``multi_token_prediction.py``), and ``ModuleSpec.params``
  defaults to ``{}``. The MLA spec already declared it; the KDA spec now
  does too, and :class:`KimiDeltaAttention` accepts and ignores it.

    * ``KimiK3Layer.layer_number`` defaults to ``layer_idx + 1``, which is
      the key Megatron's MoE aux-loss tracker indexes by
      (``router.py``). Reusing a decoder layer's number would make
      an MTP depth's aux loss overwrite a decoder layer's.

      Note :class:`MultiTokenPredictionLayer` *also* passes its own
      ``layer_number`` (1-based within the MTP block,
      ``multi_token_prediction.py``) which wins, because
      ``build_module`` kwargs override spec ``params``. Upstream comments
      that this is deliberate. The index below is therefore what
      ``layer_idx`` becomes, and the guard is that it is out of the
      decoder's range either way.
    * It is what would drive the attention-residual append schedule -- so
      it is deliberately a value for which ``appends_checkpoint`` would be
      **true** at the production geometry (93 % 12 != 0 ... but 96 % 12 ==
      0 for other shapes), and the ``use_attn_residuals=False`` override is
