"""Adapter that lets upstream Megatron `MambaLayer` plug into Primus's
`HybridStack` (the one used by the GDN/KDA hybrids).

Why this exists
---------------
`HybridStack.__init__` builds each mamba layer with:

    build_module(
        submodules.mamba_layer,
        config=...,
        residual_in_fp32=...,
        layer_number=...,
        pg_collection=...,
    )

`GatedDeltaNetLayer.__init__` and `KimiDeltaAttentionLayer.__init__` both
accept the `residual_in_fp32` kwarg, so they slot in fine.  Upstream
`MambaLayer.__init__`, however, does NOT accept it — it has
`pp_layer_offset` in its place — so plugging `MambaLayer` directly into
`HybridStack` raises:

    TypeError: MambaLayer.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument
    'residual_in_fp32'

We avoid touching upstream Megatron by wrapping `MambaLayer` in a thin
adapter that accepts `residual_in_fp32` (stored on `self` for parity with
the other hybrid layers), and never forwards it to `MambaLayer.__init__`.
`pp_layer_offset` defaults to 0 (HybridStack doesn't have pipeline parallel
plumbing for the mamba leg anyway — pp_offset is applied separately to the
TransformerLayer attention/MLP branches).
