"""Context-parallel support for the DeepSeek-V4 dense / SWA attention branch.

V4 attention materialises the query tensor at FULL head width on every tensor-parallel rank
(``deepseek_v4_attention.py`` sets ``num_attention_heads_per_partition = num_heads`` with no
``divide()``), so TP shards weights but not attention activations. Context parallelism is the
only lever that shrinks the per-rank sequence, and therefore the only way past the long-context
memory wall: measured on 8x MI308X, an unmodified 4-layer V4-Flash needs ~396 GB at 128k
against a 192 GiB card, while 32k fits in 145 GB.

For the dense (``compress_ratio == 0``) branch the CP contract is small, because that branch is
already index-driven -- causality and the sliding window live entirely in the index matrix the
sparse-MLA adapter builds, not in the kernel. A CP rank therefore needs exactly two things:

  1. the ``d_window`` post-RoPE KV rows immediately left of its shard, so a query near the shard
     start can still see its full window (:class:`LeftBoundaryExchange`), and
  2. its global row offset, so the adapter can validate the window against global positions
     while indexing into the local ``[boundary ++ local]`` buffer
     (``cp_dwindow`` / ``cp_global_start`` in ``v4_sparse_mla_adapter``).

Exchanging post-RoPE KV rather than pre-projection hidden states is deliberate: the neighbour
has already applied RoPE with the correct global positions, and it moves ``d_window`` rows
instead of a full hidden block.

Ported from NVIDIA/Megatron-LM PR #5087 (`csa_cp_utils.py`), whose CP path is THD-only; this
is the BSHD-shaped equivalent for Primus's V4 attention.
