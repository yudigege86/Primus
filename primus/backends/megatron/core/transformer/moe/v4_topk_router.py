"""Learned Top-K MoE router for DeepSeek-V4.

Reference: techblog §4 ("MoE: routing scoring") and the inference
reference at ``DeepSeek-V4-Flash/inference/model.py:Gate.forward``.

For layers with ``layer_idx >= num_hash_layers`` V4 uses a learned
top-K router. The HF-released ``Gate`` module computes a single
``[D -> num_experts]`` linear and supports three score functions:

* ``softmax`` — standard competitive normalization.
* ``sigmoid`` — independent expert scoring (V3 fallback).
* ``sqrtsoftplus`` — V4 default. ``sqrt(softplus(x))`` combines the
  positive-only behavior of softplus with the sub-linear growth of
  sqrt; sits between sigmoid (saturating) and softmax (competition)
  and yields smoother routing gradients in long training runs.

Optionally the router supports an **expert bias** correction
(``moe_router_enable_expert_bias`` / "noaux_tc" — V3-style auxiliary-free
balancing): a learnable per-expert bias is added to the score *only for
top-K selection*, and the returned routing weights are gathered from the
**un-biased** scores. This keeps gradient flow clean (probs flow back to
the gate weight, not the bias) while still letting the bias term steer
load balance.

After top-K selection, the routing weights are renormalized to sum to 1
**only when the score function is non-softmax** (matches HF; with
softmax the sum is already 1 by construction). A final scalar
``topk_scaling_factor`` ("route_scale" in the HF reference) is applied
multiplicatively.

Plan-2 P14 contract:

* :class:`DeepseekV4LearnedRouter` — standalone ``nn.Module`` that
  produces sparse ``(probs, routing_map)`` with the same ``[N, num_experts]``
  shape contract as Megatron's :class:`TopKRouter`. The eager,
  CPU-testable form is the canonical reference for G4 unit tests.
* Parameter layout:
   - ``weight``: ``nn.Parameter`` of shape ``[num_experts, hidden_size]``
     (matches both Megatron's ``TopKRouter.weight`` and HF reference
     ``Gate.weight``).
   - ``expert_bias`` (optional): ``nn.Parameter`` of shape
     ``[num_experts]`` (matches HF reference ``Gate.bias``).
* ``score_function`` ∈ ``{"softmax", "sigmoid", "sqrtsoftplus"}``.

Phase-2 of P14 will subclass Megatron's :class:`TopKRouter` directly so
the router participates in aux-loss / z-loss / dispatcher lifecycle in
production. The standalone form here remains the reference for unit
tests and the state-dict adapter (P17).

Back-compat alias ``V4TopKRouter`` is exposed but deprecated; new
callers should use :class:`DeepseekV4LearnedRouter`.
