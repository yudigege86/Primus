"""Indexer distillation loss for DeepSeek-V4 CSA layers.

The CSA lightning indexer picks which ``index_topk`` compressed KV entries each
query attends to. ``topk`` is not differentiable, so without an auxiliary
objective the indexer never receives a gradient and a from-scratch run selects
essentially at random.

DeepSeek-V3.2 (section 2.1) trains it by distillation: the indexer's score
distribution is pulled towards the distribution the *real* attention places over
the same entries, via ``KL(attention || indexer)``.

This module implements the sparse variant -- the loss is evaluated only on the
entries the indexer actually selected. That keeps the objective consistent with
what the forward pass actually consumes, and because those entries are already
gathered per query the computation stays in the ``[B, S, K]`` top-k space and
never materialises the dense ``[B, H, S, P]`` score tensor.

The target is the distribution the layer's **joint** softmax puts on those
entries, not a fresh softmax over them: a CSA layer normalises the sliding
window, the compressed entries and the sink together, so a head that spends
most of its attention on the window should carry correspondingly little weight
in the head sum. :func:`noncompressed_lse` supplies the window-plus-sink log
mass that makes the denominator the real one.

The gradient flows **one way**: into the indexer only. The target side (the
attention queries and the compressed pool) is detached inside
:func:`compute_indexer_distill_loss`, and the caller feeds the indexer from a
detached hidden state, so the KL can neither reshape the attention distribution
it is trying to imitate nor leak into the layers below.

The loss is attached to the autograd graph with :class:`V4IndexerLossAutoScaler`,
the same aux-loss autoscaler pattern this training stack already uses for the
MoE auxiliary loss and the MTP loss: it passes a tensor through untouched in
forward and seeds the auxiliary loss with a gradient of one in backward, so the
aux objective backpropagates without having to be threaded through every forward
return signature.
