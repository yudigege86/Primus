"""Stable Latent MoE — the FFN sub-block of the Kimi K3 text backbone.

Reference: ``KimiSparseMoeBlock`` (``modeling_kimi_linear.py``) and
``KimiMoEGate``.

What "latent" means
-------------------
The 896 routed experts do **not** run in model space. A single pair of
projections, shared by every expert in the layer, bottlenecks the token
into a ``routed_expert_hidden_size = 3584`` latent space; the experts live
there; one shared projection lifts the combined result back to 7168::

    identity = hidden_states
    topk_idx, topk_w = gate(hidden_states)          # FULL-WIDTH router
    h = routed_expert_down_proj(hidden_states)      # 7168 -> 3584
    y = moe_infer(h, topk_idx, topk_w)              # experts in latent
    y = routed_expert_norm(y)                       # the "STABLE" trick
    y = routed_expert_up_proj(y)                    # 3584 -> 7168
    y = y + shared_experts(identity)                # bypasses the latent

Per expert this is ``3 x 3584 x 3072 ~ 33.0 M`` parameters instead of
``3 x 7168 x 3072 ~ 66.1 M`` in model space — the bottleneck halves the
expert cost, which is what makes 896 experts affordable.

Three things are easy to get wrong, and all three are asserted by
``tests/unit_tests/megatron/transformer/kimi_k3/test_stable_latent_moe.py``:

1. The router scores the **full-width** hidden state. ``self.gate(...)``
   runs *before* the down-projection, so the router weight is
   ``[num_experts, hidden_size]`` and never
   ``[num_experts, latent]``.
2. The norm is applied to the **already-combined, top-k-weighted sum** of
   expert outputs, inside the bottleneck, before the up-projection — not
   per-expert and not after the up-projection.
3. The shared experts consume ``identity``, i.e. the **pre**-down-projection
   hidden state, at width ``moe_intermediate_size * num_shared_experts``
   (3072 * 2 = 6144) — note ``moe_intermediate_size``, not
   ``intermediate_size`` (33792).

Why this class is so short
--------------------------
Upstream Megatron **already implements the latent bottleneck**, under the
name ``config.moe_latent_size``:

* ``moe_layer.py`` builds ``fc1_latent_proj`` / ``fc2_latent_proj``
  as duplicated ``TELinear`` (shared across experts, as K3 requires);
* ``moe_layer.py`` applies the down-projection in ``preprocess``,
  which runs **after** ``route`` — so the router already sees
  the full-width hidden state;
* ``moe_layer.py`` applies the up-projection in ``postprocess``,
  after the dispatcher combine;
* ``moe_layer.py`` computes the shared experts on the original
  ``hidden_states``, before ``route`` / ``preprocess`` — the K3 ``identity``
  bypass, for free;
* ``experts.py`` (TEGroupedMLP) and ``mlp.py``
  (SequentialMLP) size the routed experts on ``moe_latent_size`` while
  leaving ``is_expert=False`` shared experts in model space.

The **only** thing upstream is missing is the norm between combine and
up-projection. So ``StableLatentMoE`` subclasses :class:`MoELayer`, maps
``routed_expert_hidden_size`` onto ``moe_latent_size``, and overrides
``postprocess`` to insert that one call. With
``routed_expert_hidden_size=None`` the class runs the parent's code path
untouched, so it is *identical by construction* to a stock
:class:`MoELayer` rather than merely numerically close.

An earlier design sketched hand-rolled ``linear_latent_down`` /
``linear_latent_up`` / ``token_dispatcher`` submodule slots; those turned out
redundant against the upstream this tree actually vendors, so they are not used.

The router
----------
No new router class. ``KimiMoEGate`` is DeepSeek-V3's ``noaux_tc``, and
``moe_utils.topk_routing_with_score_function`` is the same math line for
line: sigmoid over an fp32 gating GEMM, ``expert_bias`` shifts
**selection only** while the returned weights are gathered from the
un-shifted scores, renormalize by the top-k sum with the same ``1e-20``
epsilon, then scale. Configure it with
``moe_router_score_function="sigmoid"`` +
``moe_router_enable_expert_bias=True``. The release has
``num_expert_group == topk_group == 1``, so HF's group-limited branch is
dead code; leave ``moe_router_num_groups`` / ``moe_router_group_topk`` at
``None`` and no machinery is built for it.

Load balancing
--------------
Phase 1 uses ``seq_aux_loss`` at ``1e-3`` plus the ``noaux_tc`` expert
bias, i.e. DeepSeek-V4's configuration. Kimi
K3's published rule is "Quantile Balancing" (tech report §2.3.3, Eq. 14),
which has no public reference implementation; Primus implements it in
``k3_quantile_balancing.py``. It is a
*bias-update rule*, not a loss, so it does not belong in this module: it
replaces ``get_updated_expert_bias`` at
``megatron/core/distributed/finalize_model_grads.py``, which is
the single place the sign-based DeepSeek-V3 update is applied to
``TopKRouter.expert_bias``. See :data:`QUANTILE_BALANCING_HOOK_SITE`.
