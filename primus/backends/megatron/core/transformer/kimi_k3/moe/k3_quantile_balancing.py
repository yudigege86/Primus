"""Quantile Balancing — Kimi K3's MoE load-balancing rule.

Kimi K3 does **not** use DeepSeek-V3's ``b <- b + u * sign(violation)`` bias
update. Tech report §2.3.3 replaces it wholesale: the expert bias is *set*
from a per-expert quantile of the routing margin. The report's own framing of
why (verbatim from the extracted text):

    The original method updates b with the fixed-step rule
    ``b_j^(t+1) = b_j^(t) + u * sign(...)`` for which u trades off slow
    adaptation against load oscillation. Maintaining balanced loads becomes
    more challenging as LatentMoE increases the routed expert pool to 896 per
    layer.

The rule
--------
With ``m`` tokens, ``n`` routed experts, top-``k`` selection, and target load
``q := m*k/n``:

.. code-block:: text

    s_i        = sigmoid(W_r x_i)                       raw router scores  [n]
    tau_i      = (k+1)-th largest of (s_i + b^(t))      the token's cutoff
    margin_ij  = s_ij - tau_i                            RAW score - BIASED cutoff
    b_hat_j    = -quantile_{1-k/n}( margin_{:,j} )       Eq. 14, line 1
    b^(t+1)    = b_hat - mean(b_hat)                     Eq. 14, line 2

Three details that are easy to get wrong, all forced by the report's prose
rather than by the (glyph-lossy) equation image:

1. **The cutoff is taken from the *biased* scores, the margin from the *raw*
   ones.** "The margins subtract the biased cutoff tau_i^(t) from the raw score
   s_ij, so the old bias enters the update only through the cutoffs." So this
   is a *set*, not an increment: ``b^(t+1)`` contains no additive ``b^(t)``.
2. **The sign.** The PDF drops the leading minus in Eq. 14, but the derivation
   fixes it: "the token count routed to expert j under a candidate bias
   b_hat_j is ``sum_i 1[s_ij + b_hat_j > tau_i]``, which is monotonically
   decreasing in the threshold ``-b_hat_j``. Assuming no ties, setting this
   count to q makes ``-b_hat_j`` the (q+1)-th largest margin." Hence the
   negation.
3. **Mean-centring is cosmetic, not corrective.** "the second line removes a
   common offset that leaves Top-k selection unchanged" — adding a constant to
   every ``b_j`` cannot change ``argtopk(s_i + b)``. It only stops the bias
   drifting. Configurable, on by default.

Taking the cutoff from a Top-(k+1) pass is the report's own trick: "Taking the
cutoff from Top-(k+1) routing avoids a separate token-side quantile." Upstream
Megatron routes with Top-k and there is no clean seam to widen it to Top-(k+1),
so this module runs its own ``torch.topk(..., k+1)`` over the biased scores.
That is *mathematically identical* — the first k entries of a Top-(k+1) are the
Top-k — at the cost of one extra top-k per MoE layer per microbatch.

Histogram estimation
--------------------
Also §2.3.3, and this is what settles the batch-scope question:

    At scale, the quantile in Eq. 14 spans **the full global batch**, whose
    margins number in the millions and are spread across **ranks and
    accumulation steps**, so gathering them for an exact quantile is not viable
    at training time. We instead read each expert's quantile from a histogram
    of its margins: **a single all-reduce** sums the per-rank bin counts, and
    the quantile is recovered from the pooled counts.

So the statistic is per global batch, accumulated over microbatches, reduced
once across ranks, and is **not** an EMA. That is exactly the cadence and the
collective at which Megatron already runs the sign-based rule, in
``_update_router_expert_bias`` (``finalize_model_grads.py``) — which is why
:data:`k3_stable_latent_moe.QUANTILE_BALANCING_HOOK_SITE`
points there. The one thing upstream does not have is the *statistic*: it
gathers ``local_tokens_per_expert``, and Quantile Balancing needs routing
scores. :class:`QuantileBalancingMixin` adds a ``local_margin_histogram``
buffer beside it.

What the report does **not** say, and is therefore configurable
--------------------------------------------------------------
* **The binning.** Range and bin count are not stated anywhere in any
  extraction we have; the sentence that would have said so is truncated. The
  defaults here are ``[-1, 1]`` over 1024 uniform bins, chosen because
  ``sigmoid`` confines the raw score to ``(0, 1)`` and a mean-centred bias
  keeps ``tau`` close to that interval, and because the resulting bin width
  (1.95e-3) is the same order as DeepSeek-V3's ``moe_router_bias_update_rate``
  of 1e-3, i.e. the resolution the old rule was happy with. Out-of-range
  margins are clamped into the end bins and counted, so saturation is visible
  rather than silent.
* **Whether TP replication should be de-duplicated.** It does not matter: the
  all-reduce runs over TP x CP x DP (matching upstream's rule), so under TP the
  same token is counted once per TP rank — but a quantile is invariant to
  uniform duplication of the whole sample, so the estimate is unchanged.
* **The update cadence** is stated indirectly ("QB derives the next bias from a
  single forward pass" + global batch), so the default is every optimizer step.
  ``quantile_balancing_update_interval`` widens it, and
  ``quantile_balancing_ema_decay`` turns the set into an EMA, both off by
  default, so the two readings the report leaves open are reachable without
  editing code.

Memory: the histogram is ``num_experts x num_bins`` int64 **per MoE layer**
(8 MB per layer at 896 experts / 1024 bins), and the all-reduce sees all layers
stacked. Reduce ``quantile_balancing_num_bins`` if that matters.
