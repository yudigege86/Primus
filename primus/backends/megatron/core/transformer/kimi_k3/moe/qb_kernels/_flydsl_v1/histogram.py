"""Torch-facing FlyDSL Quantile Balancing statistic.

:func:`flydsl_compute_margin_histogram` has the same signature and the same
return types as :func:`..._eager.reference.compute_margin_histogram` and is
interchangeable with it. No autograd wrapper: the statistic runs under
``@torch.no_grad()`` inside ``QuantileBalancingMixin._accumulate_margin_histogram``
and the report freezes the bias at inference, so this computation has no
backward and never needs one. That is a property of the algorithm, not an
omission.

What is fused, and what is deliberately not
-------------------------------------------
The kernel takes over everything downstream of the cutoff. The **cutoff itself
stays in torch**, and that is a measured decision rather than a shortcut:

===========================  ============  =========================
op (4096 tokens x 32 experts)  median µs    where it goes
===========================  ============  =========================
``sigmoid``                          7.5   torch (bit-exactness)
``add_bias``                         7.9   torch (bit-exactness)
``topk`` (k+1)                      13.6   **torch** — library selection
``margin_sub``                       7.1   kernel
``scale_floor``                     14.7   kernel
``clamp_count`` (x2)                36.1   kernel
``clamp_to_int64``                  11.3   kernel
``offset_reshape``                   8.0   kernel
``bincount``                       102.2   kernel
===========================  ============  =========================

The six stages the kernel absorbs are 179.4 µs of the 208.4 µs total, i.e.
**86 %**; ``torch.topk`` is 6.5 %. Re-implementing a top-(k+1) selection in
FlyDSL would be the largest and least certain part of the work for the smallest
share of the win — and ``torch.topk`` is a tuned library kernel that a
hand-rolled ``O(E²)`` rank count (1024 comparisons per token at ``E = 32``,
802 816 at ``E = 896``) would not approach. ``sigmoid`` and ``add_bias`` stay in
torch for a different reason: the bin index is a ``floor``, so any last-bit
difference upstream of it moves a count into the neighbouring bin, and matching
``torch.sigmoid`` bit-for-bit in the kernel is not something to bet parity on.
The same discontinuity is why the kernel scales by ``1/width`` rather than
dividing — see the kernel module's docstring; matching the oracle beats being
more accurate than it.

So the honest description of this backend is: **one fused kernel replacing six
launches, with three cheap torch ops kept in front of it on purpose.**

The kernel is slower above ~6 K tokens, and that is guarded
-----------------------------------------------------------
The kernel's cost is **global-atomic contention**, which scales with tokens per
bin. ``torch.bincount`` privatises or sorts and does not, so the eager path barely
grows with the token count while the kernel grows linearly. Measured at 32
experts / 1024 bins:

===============  ==========  ==========  ========
tokens           eager µs    kernel µs   speedup
===============  ==========  ==========  ========
2 048                 246.5        68.2    3.61x
6 144                 233.0       107.9    2.16x
16 384                231.6       233.3    0.99x
32 768                290.8       466.2    **0.62x**
===============  ==========  ==========  ========

So selecting ``flydsl`` at a large micro-batch would make training *slower* while
looking like an optimisation, which is worse than having no kernel at all.
:func:`kernel_beats_eager` therefore gates the launch on the token count and
falls back to the eager path outside the measured win, logging once so the
decision is visible in the run's log rather than only in this docstring. The
threshold is :data:`KERNEL_MAX_TOKENS`; ``quantile_balancing_kernel_max_tokens``
overrides it, and ``0`` disables the guard entirely.

The threshold is a stopgap, not the answer. The fix is an LDS-privatised
histogram, which needs the grid re-mapped from ``(token, expert)`` pairs to
``(expert, token-slice)``.

    Two things the ladder settles. The **cause** is atomic contention: the loss
    tracks counts per bin (``num_tokens / num_bins``), and both columns degrade
    monotonically in it while the eager column barely moves — ``torch.bincount``
    privatises or sorts and the kernel does not. The **crossover depends on
    ``num_experts``** after all, and not through contention: each expert's
    histogram row receives exactly ``num_tokens`` increments regardless of how
    many experts there are, so contention per address is identical. What differs
    is the eager baseline — ``torch.topk`` grows from 6.6 % of it at 32 experts to
    17 % at 896, so at 896 the kernel has less to win and crosses over sooner.

    The threshold is the last rung that wins in **both** columns, i.e. 6 144. It
    is a single number rather than a per-expert-count table because two points per
    column is enough to place a conservative bound and not enough to fit a curve.
