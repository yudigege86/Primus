"""Eager reference for the Kimi K3 attention-residual mixer.

A verbatim extraction of what ``AttentionResidualMixer.forward`` used to do
inline, so that it can serve as the permanent numerical oracle for the fused
FlyDSL kernel — the same role :mod:`...kda_kernels._eager.reference` plays for
KDA. ``test_attention_residual.py`` already pins this arithmetic bit-exactly
against an independent transcription of ``_apply_attn_res``
(``modeling_kimi_linear.py``), and that test keeps passing unchanged,
which is what makes the extraction safe.

Three details, restated here because this is now the file a kernel is checked
against:

1. **The output mixes the un-normalised candidates.** ``v`` is the raw
   ``cat([block_residual, prefix_sum])``; the RMS normalisation feeds the
   *scores* only.
2. **The scorer is rank-1**, the elementwise product of the RMSNorm gain and
   the ``[1, hidden]`` projection row.
3. **All of it runs in fp32** and casts back once at the end.
