"""Fused FlyDSL forward kernel for the Kimi K3 attention-residual mixer.

One workgroup per token computes, for ``C = num_blocks + 1`` candidates,

    ss[c]   = Σ_d v[c,d]²
    dot[c]  = Σ_d v[c,d] · w[d]
    r[c]    = rsqrt(ss[c]/H + eps)
    s[c]    = dot[c] · r[c]
    p       = softmax(s)
    out[d]  = Σ_c p[c] · v[c,d]

where ``v`` is the concatenation of the ``num_blocks`` checkpoints and the
running stream, and ``w`` is the fused rank-1 scorer.

Why this is the fusion, and what it removes
-------------------------------------------
The eager form is not arithmetic-bound; it is materialisation-bound. It writes
six full-size ``[tokens, C, hidden]`` intermediates — the ``cat``, the fp32
up-cast, the variance, the normalised ``k``, the score product, and the matmul's
read — and five of them are fp32. Measured at ``tokens = 4096, C = 4,
hidden = 2048``: ~1.07 GB of traffic for a 67 MB bf16 input, 404 µs forward.

Two algebraic facts collapse all of it:

* ``scores = rsqrt(mean(v²) + eps) · <v, w>``. The RMS normalisation never has
  to be *applied* to ``v``; the reduction it scales is ``<v, w>``, and both
  reductions come out of **one** pass. That kills the ``k`` tensor.
* ``out`` is a convex combination of ``v`` itself, so the second pass reads the
  same bytes and writes only ``[tokens, hidden]``.

So the kernel reads ``v`` twice in its input dtype and writes one output, i.e.
~151 MB against the eager path's ~1.07 GB at that shape. The ``cat`` never
happens: the two source tensors are passed as separate pointers and the
candidate axis is a build-time constant, so which pointer a candidate lives
behind is resolved during tracing.

Layout and geometry
-------------------
Every tensor is passed flat.

* ``BR``: ``[N, NB, H]`` in the model dtype (bf16 or fp32)
* ``PS``: ``[N, H]`` in the model dtype
* ``W``: ``[H]`` fp32 — the fused scorer, formed outside the kernel
* ``OUT``: ``[N, H]`` in the model dtype
* ``RSAV``, ``DSAV``: ``[N, C]`` fp32 — ``r`` and ``dot``, saved for the
  backward so it never has to re-reduce them

``BLOCK`` is 256 threads when ``H % 256 == 0`` and 64 otherwise, and ``H`` must
be a multiple of 64; the launcher checks it and the Python caller falls back to
eager. Each thread owns the strided slice ``d = tid + j·BLOCK``, which keeps
every global access coalesced across the workgroup.

gfx950 / CDNA4. There is no MFMA here on purpose: every contraction is a
reduction of one vector against another, i.e. rank-1, so an MFMA would be fed a
single row and waste 15/16 of the tile. The arithmetic is VALU FMA and the
kernel is bound by HBM, which is the thing being optimised.

Three FlyDSL tracing rules are load-bearing here:

* ``rocdl`` is unreachable from a helper defined *inside* a traced body, so
  :func:`_nat_exp` and :func:`_rsqrt_refined` sit at module scope and are
  called from the body.
* a Python ``if`` inside a traced body does not propagate branch-local
  rebindings out, so every build-time choice — which pointer a candidate lives
  behind, which element type to load — is made by **indexing a list built
  before the body**, never by an ``if`` statement.
* ``exp`` is not exposed; ``rocdl.exp2`` (hardware ``v_exp_f32``) is.

#: Widest workgroup used. 256 threads is one output element per thread for
#: ``H = 256`` and a clean strided slice for every larger multiple.
MAX_BLOCK = 256
#: Narrowest workgroup, one full wave.
MIN_BLOCK = 64
#: The mixer is only ever built at the model's hidden size, so a
#: multiple-of-64 requirement covers every real shape (2048, 7168) and every
#: test shape worth having.
HIDDEN_ALIGN = 64
#: Candidate count ceiling. ``C = ceil(num_layers / attn_res_block_size) + 1``,
#: which is 9 for the 93-layer release and 4 for the scaled config. The
#: candidate loop is fully unrolled, so a very large ``C`` would blow up the

MAX_CANDIDATES = 33

#: Test-only defects the builder can emit, so the parity test can be shown to
#: have discrimination power. A test that passes against a broken kernel is
#: worthless, and the only way to know is to break the kernel — in the emitted
#: MLIR, not in the torch glue around it. Production never passes ``inject``,
#: and :func:`build_attn_res_mixer_fwd` rejects an unknown name, so a typo in a
#: test cannot silently become "no injection at all".
#:
#: ``mix_normalised``
#:     Mix the RMS-normalised candidates instead of the raw ones. The easiest
#:     thing to get wrong and the one the reference is most explicit about
#:     (``modeling_kimi_linear.py`` builds ``k``, mixes ``v``).
#: ``score_unnormalised``
#:     The mirror image: score the raw candidates, skipping the RMS scaling.
#: ``no_softmax_max``
#:     Drop the max subtraction in the softmax. Algebraically a no-op, so it
#:     only shows up as overflow at a large score spread — which is why the
#:     test for it uses a wide ``proj_weight`` rather than the default fixture.
#: ``drop_eps``
#:     Leave ``eps`` out of the rsqrt. Only observable when a candidate has
#:     (near-)zero norm, which is not hypothetical: ``block_residual`` starts as
#:     literal zeros at layer 0 of a fresh model.

#: Build-time variants that are **measured** to sit inside the fp32 parity band,
#: i.e. things one might expect to be defects and that are not. They are kept
#: buildable so the claim stays testable rather than becoming folklore; each has
#: a test that records the measurement.
#:
#: ``no_newton``
#:     Use the raw ``v_rsq_f32`` with no Newton refinement. Measured inside the
#:     ``atol = rtol = 1e-5`` band: gfx950's ``V_RSQ_F32`` is accurate to about
#:     ``2^-22``, the score is ``dot · r`` and only feeds a softmax, so the error
#:     never reaches the output. The refinement ships anyway — it is three VALU
#:     ops **per candidate**, against ``C·H`` FMAs of real work — but it is not
#:     load-bearing, and saying so is more useful than implying it is.
#: ``stream_first``
#:     Put the running stream first in the candidate order instead of last.
#:     Measured **bit-identical**, and it has to be: softmax is
#:     permutation-equivariant and the output is a sum over every candidate, so
#:     the mixer's arithmetic cannot see candidate order at all. Candidate order
#:     is therefore only checkable one level up, where a checkpoint slot has to
#:     line up with the layer that wrote it — which is what
#:     ``test_attention_residual.py``'s block-level tests do.
