"""Kimi K3 attention residuals.

Kimi K3 replaces the ordinary ``x = x + sublayer(x)`` residual with a
**learned softmax mixture over a growing set of cross-layer checkpoints
plus the running residual stream**. The reference implementation is
``_apply_attn_res`` (``modeling_kimi_linear.py``), driven by
``KimiDecoderLayer._forward_attn_residual`` twice per layer and by
``KimiLinearModel._apply_output_attn_res`` once after the stack.

This module owns the mixer only; the per-layer bookkeeping (when a
checkpoint is appended, when the running sum resets) lives in
``kimi_k3_block.KimiK3Layer``.

Three details of the reference are easy to get wrong, so they are
called out here and pinned by ``test_attention_residual.py``:

1. **The output mixes the un-normalised candidates.** ``v`` is the raw
   ``cat([block_residual, prefix_sum])``; ``k`` is its RMS-normalised
   form. The normalisation feeds the *scores* only
   (``modeling_kimi_linear.py``). Mixing ``k`` instead would rescale
   every candidate to unit RMS and destroy the residual stream's
   magnitude.
2. **The scorer is rank-1.** ``score_weight`` is the elementwise product
   of the RMSNorm gain ``[hidden]`` and the ``[1, hidden]`` projection
   weight, so scoring costs one dot product per candidate and
   ``2 * hidden`` parameters. The two factors could be folded into a
   single vector at build time; they are kept separate because the
   released checkpoint stores them separately as
   ``*_res_norm.weight`` / ``*_res_proj.weight``.
3. **All of it runs in fp32** and casts back once at the end.

Layout note. The reference flattens ``[batch, seq]`` into a single token
axis and carries ``block_residual`` as ``[num_tokens, num_blocks,
hidden]``. Megatron is sequence-first, so this module keeps the tokens
as ``[seq, batch]`` and the candidate axis where the reference has it:
``prefix_sum`` is ``[..., hidden]`` and ``block_residual`` is
``[..., num_blocks, hidden]``. ``torch.matmul`` broadcasts over the
leading dims identically either way, so the arithmetic is unchanged --
``test_attention_residual.py`` asserts bit-equality against the
reference with the leading dims flattened.

    Args:
        config: the runtime config. ``hidden_size`` and
            ``layernorm_epsilon`` are read from it unless overridden.
        hidden_size: candidate width. Defaults to ``config.hidden_size``.
        eps: RMSNorm epsilon. Defaults to ``config.layernorm_epsilon``.

    Parameters:
        norm_weight: ``[hidden]``, HF ``*_res_norm.weight``. Ones at init,
            so a fresh mixer scores every candidate by the projection
            direction alone.
        proj_weight: ``[1, hidden]``, HF ``*_res_proj.weight``. Kept 2-D
            to match ``nn.Linear(hidden, 1, bias=False)``'s layout, which
            is what the reference squeezes at ``modeling_kimi_linear.py``.

    Neither parameter is tensor-parallel: the residual stream is
    full-width on every TP rank, and the score reduces over the whole
    hidden axis, so the mixer needs no collective. Under sequence
    parallelism each rank holds a different slice of the token axis, so
    the two gradients *are* rank-dependent and must be all-reduced across
    TP -- which is exactly what ``sequence_parallel=True`` on a parameter
    asks ``finalize_model_grads`` to do (same treatment as the router's
    weight, ``router.py``).
