"""Native FlyDSL kernel for the **adjoint** of KDA's two score matrices.

Profiling measured :meth:`..ops._DecayScores.backward` at **12871 µs of a
23164 µs backward — 56 %**, because it recomputed
:func:`..ops.decay_scores_torch` under ``enable_grad`` and differentiated it:
~40 elementwise ops and batched GEMMs on 100 MB tensors, doubled by autograd,
for ~8 GFLOP of real arithmetic. This kernel replaces all of it with one launch.

The adjoint, and why it is the same kernel family
-------------------------------------------------
With ``E[r,c,d] = exp(cg[r,d] − cg[c,d])`` the forward is

    Aqk[r,c] = Σ_d q[r,d]·E[r,c,d]·k[c,d]     (c ≤ r, else 0)
    Akk[r,c] = Σ_d k[r,d]·E[r,c,d]·k[c,d]     (c < r, else 0)

so with the upstream gradients masked to those same triangles — the masked-off
entries are outputs that are *identically* zero, so they carry no gradient —
four contractions fall out, and each is the forward's own blocked
decay-weighted contraction with **the contraction axis swapped**:

===============  ==================================================  =========
quantity         definition                                          contracts
===============  ==================================================  =========
``dq[r,d]``      ``Σ_c dAqk[r,c]·E[r,c,d]·k[c,d]``                    over ``c``
``A2[r,d]``      ``Σ_c dAkk[r,c]·E[r,c,d]·k[c,d]``                    over ``c``
``A1[c,d]``      ``Σ_r dAqk[r,c]·E[r,c,d]·q[r,d]``                    over ``r``
``A3[c,d]``      ``Σ_r dAkk[r,c]·E[r,c,d]·k[r,d]``                    over ``r``
===============  ==================================================  =========

and then, elementwise and free,

    dk  = A1 + A2 + A3
    dcg = q·dq + k·(A2 − A1 − A3)

``dq`` and ``A2`` share their ``k·E`` operand; ``A1`` and ``A3`` share the
transposed ``dA`` access. So one workgroup produces all four.

The ``1/Γ`` guard, re-derived for the swapped axis
--------------------------------------------------
Every ``[SB, SB]`` block still factors ``E[r,c,d]`` through a reference row
``n``, ``E = exp(cg[r,d]−cg[n,d])·exp(cg[n,d]−cg[c,d]) = lf[r,d]·rf[c,d]``, and
``n`` is still chosen so that **both factors are ≤ 1** off the diagonal:

* the ``Σ_c`` direction (``dq``, ``A2``) owns row-block ``b`` and contracts all
  earlier columns at once, so ``n`` is the **first row of block b**: rows ``r``
  are ``≥ n`` and columns ``c`` are ``< n``, hence ``lf ≤ 1`` and ``rf ≤ 1``.
  This is exactly the forward's choice.
* the ``Σ_r`` direction (``A1``, ``A3``) owns *column*-block ``b`` and contracts
  all later rows, so the forward's choice would put ``rf = exp(cg[n]−cg[c])``
  with ``c > n`` and let it reach ``exp(75)``. ``n`` is therefore the **last row
  of block b**: columns ``c`` are ``≤ n`` and rows ``r`` are ``> n``, so again
  both factors are ``≤ 1``.
* the diagonal block keeps the forward's **midpoint** reference, so
  ``|exponent| ≤ (SB/2)·|g|_max = 40``.

Both factors ``≤ 1`` also means no *gratuitous* underflow: the product is the
true value, so whenever a factor underflows to zero the true entry is itself
below ``fp32``'s smallest normal.

On the diagonal the largest intermediate is
``SB · |dA|·|k| · exp(40) ≈ 3.8e18 · |dA|·|k|``, because the upstream gradient
is masked *before* it is contracted and so the above-diagonal ``lf·rf`` products
that force the forward's ``exp(75) = 3.7e32`` bound are never formed at all.
**The margin at ``SUB_BLOCK = 16`` is therefore wider here than in the
forward**, and 32 would still be the first unprovable size.
``test_kda_flydsl_scores_bwd_kernel_survives_a_saturated_gate`` pins it with
``g = −5`` everywhere.

Layout and geometry
-------------------
One workgroup per chunk, ``NB = B·H·NC`` of them, and a compile-time loop over
the ``NSB = C/SB`` row/column blocks. Block ``b`` is visited exactly once, as
the row owner for the ``b`` pairs to its left, as the column owner for the
``NSB−1−b`` pairs below it, and once on the diagonal — ``NSB+1`` sub-block
contractions whatever ``b`` is, so the compile-time schedule is balanced by
construction. All four accumulators for block ``b`` live in **registers**
(``MR·NR`` elements each), which is why the owner is a whole block rather than
a pair: nothing has to be re-read or atomically combined.

* ``Q``, ``K``, ``CG``, ``DQ``, ``DK``, ``DCG``: ``[NB, C, K_DIM]`` fp32
* ``DAqk``, ``DAkk``: ``[NB, C, C]`` fp32

fp32 VALU throughout, like the forward kernel and for the same two reasons:
``v_mfma_f32_16x16x4f32`` SIGABRTs in this ``flydsl`` build, and a bf16 MFMA path
would round ``dA`` and ``k`` at the point they
are consumed, which the gradients' 11× tolerance margin could absorb but which
has to be *measured* before it is shipped.

Two tracing rules shape the code below.

* Every build-time choice is made by indexing a dict of closures rather than by
  an ``if`` statement: the AST rewriter routes every
  ``if`` through ``scf_if_dispatch``.
* **Every** ``for`` in the body iterates ``range_constexpr``, including the
  two-deep ``MR``/``NR`` register loops. ``range_constexpr`` *is* ``range``
  (``flydsl/expr/__init__.py``) — it is a marker the rewriter matches by name
  (``ast_rewriter.py`` ``_is_range_constexpr``), and a plain ``range`` loop
  becomes a traced loop whose induction variable is an ``ArithValue``, which
  then cannot index the Python list an accumulator lives in.
