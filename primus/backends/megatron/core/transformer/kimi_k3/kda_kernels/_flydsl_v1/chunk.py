"""Chunkwise-parallel KDA assembled around the FlyDSL kernel.

Same algorithm as :func:`..._eager.reference.eager_chunk_kda` — read that
docstring for the derivation — with the two stages the eager form is
deliberately slow at replaced:

===========================================  ==========================================
eager reference                              here
===========================================  ==========================================
``[C, C]`` scores built one column at a       one FlyDSL kernel launch
time (``C`` launches, and a                  (:mod:`.kda_decay_scores_kernel`)
``[B, H, NC, C, C, K]`` backward
intermediate)
``(I − L)^{-1}`` by ``C``-step Python         one FlyDSL kernel launch, the
forward substitution                         matrix resident in LDS
                                             (:mod:`.kda_ut_inverse_kernel`)
the inter-chunk state sweep, ``NC``           one FlyDSL kernel launch, state
serialised steps of small torch GEMMs         resident in LDS (:mod:`.sweep`)
===========================================  ==========================================

The third row is the second optimisation pass. Profiling measured the sweep at 95 % of
the forward (7902 µs against a 340 µs score kernel) purely because it was 64
serialised launches of GEMMs far too small to fill an MI355X, with the state
round-tripping through HBM every step. :func:`.sweep.fused_chunk_sweep` keeps
only the genuinely sequential ``[K, V]`` recurrence inside a kernel and hands
every per-chunk term back to a single batched GEMM.

The ``W``/``U`` projections are left to batched torch GEMMs: they were never the
bottleneck and hipBLAS already runs them at library speed.

Backward
--------
:func:`flydsl_chunk_kda_bwd` recomputes the assembly under ``enable_grad`` and
differentiates it, rather than hand-deriving the chunked adjoint. So the
gradient is correct by construction from the forward it is paired with, only
the five input tensors are kept between the passes, and the FlyDSL kernel runs
in the backward too. The cost is one extra forward evaluation, which is the
same trade ``fla`` makes by default (its ``disable_recompute=False``). The sweep
is the one stage that cannot work that way — autograd cannot see through a
custom kernel — so :class:`.sweep._FusedSweep` carries the analytic adjoint of
its own four lines, and runs the *same* kernel in reverse to get it.
