"""The chunk's decay-weighted operand preparation, as one kernel plus its adjoint.

Profiling left the production forward at 2749 µs on device with **half of
it torch elementwise glue**. The largest connected
piece was six ops producing the sweep's state-independent operands:

    Γ = exp(cg);  QΓ = q ⊙ Γ;  KΓ = k ⊙ Γ;  KG = k ⊙ exp(ct − cg);  dec = exp(ct)

each a full HBM round trip on a 100–200 MB fp32 tensor for one ``exp`` of real
arithmetic. :mod:`.kda_chunk_prep_kernel` does all of it in one coalesced pass.

Autograd cannot see through a custom kernel, so the adjoint is written out here
rather than recovered by recomputation. With ``ct[d] = cg[C−1, d]``,
``G = exp(cg)`` and ``E = exp(ct − cg)``, and writing ``A = dKΓ ⊙ G``,
``B = dKG ⊙ E``::

    dq  = dQΓ ⊙ G
    dk  = A + B
    dcg = q ⊙ dq + k ⊙ (A − B)
    dct = Σ_r (k ⊙ B)[r] + d_dec ⊙ dec        and  dcg[C−1] += dct

Each line is the chain rule on one of the four outputs: ``∂QΓ/∂cg = QΓ``,
``∂KΓ/∂cg = KΓ`` and ``∂KG/∂cg = −KG`` because the exponent enters with the
opposite sign there, and ``ct`` is a *row* of ``cg`` rather than an input of its
own, so its gradient lands back on the last row.

``G`` and ``E`` are recomputed in the backward rather than saved. Saving them
would be 400 MB of extra residency per layer, and recovering them by division
(``G = KΓ / k``) is exactly the kind of thing this codebase does not do — ``k``
has zeros and ``G`` underflows to zero at ``cg = −320``.

:func:`chunk_prep_torch` is the pure-torch twin: same operations in the same
order, so it is both the unit-test oracle for the kernel and the fallback for
geometries the kernel cannot take. Same discipline as
:func:`..ops.decay_scores_torch` and :func:`..sweep.state_sweep_torch`.
