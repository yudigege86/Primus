"""Kimi Delta Attention kernels — single entry point for every backend.

``KimiDeltaAttention`` resolves its compute kernel through
:func:`resolve_kda_backend`, so this module is the one place that maps a
backend name to its functional entry. The layout mirrors
:mod:`primus.backends.megatron.core.transformer.v4_attention_kernels`.

Backends
--------

``eager``
    Pure-PyTorch chunkwise-parallel reference (:mod:`._eager`):
    :func:`eager_chunk_kda`. The numerical ground truth; always
    importable, no optional dependency, and differentiable.
``eager_recurrent``
    The ``O(T)`` literal recurrence (:mod:`._eager`):
    :func:`eager_recurrent_kda`. Correct by inspection and used as the
    oracle for the chunked form; far too slow for training.
``fla``
    ``flash-linear-attention``'s fused Triton ``chunk_kda``
    (:mod:`._fla`), loaded LAZILY via :func:`load_fla_kda_backend`.
``flydsl``
    Native FlyDSL kernel (:mod:`._flydsl_v1`), gfx950 / CDNA4 only,
    loaded LAZILY via :func:`load_flydsl_kda_backend`. Its intra-chunk
    score matrices come from a ``@flyc.kernel``; the surrounding
    projections and state sweep are batched torch GEMMs. See
    ``kda_kernels/README.md`` for what it does and does not accelerate.

``fla`` and ``flydsl`` are imported on demand only. Each is an optional dependency
(declared for the Megatron pretrain hook, not for the core package), and
importing it eagerly would make *any* ``import ...kda_kernels`` fail on a
build without it — even when the caller selected ``eager``. That is the
same rationale as the gluon/flydsl lazy loaders in
``v4_attention_kernels``.

All backends share one signature so the eager reference and a fused
kernel are interchangeable at the call site::

    o, final_state = backend(
        q, k, v, g, beta,
        scale=None, initial_state=None, output_final_state=False,
        use_qk_l2norm_in_kernel=False, chunk_size=64,
    )

with ``q, k, g: [B, T, H, K]``, ``v: [B, T, H, V]``, ``beta: [B, T, H]``,
``g`` in log space and ``beta`` already sigmoid-activated. See
:mod:`._eager.reference` for the full contract.
