Loss computation for diffusion models.

This module provides reusable loss computation logic for different
diffusion training objectives. All functions are pure (no state),
making them easy to test and reusable across different model architectures.

Supported loss types:
    - Flow Matching: Used by Flux, SD3, and video models
    - Epsilon Prediction: Used by DDPM and older models
    - V-Prediction: Alternative parameterization

All loss functions accept tensors of any shape and reduce to scalar.

    Compute flow matching loss with optional masking.

    Flow matching models predict the velocity field that transforms
    noise to clean latents. The training objective is:

    Formula: target = noise - clean_latents
             loss = MSE(prediction, target)

    This loss is model-agnostic and works with any tensor shape,
    making it reusable across 2D (images) and 3D (video) models.

    Args:
        prediction: Model output (predicted velocity) [any shape]
        clean_latents: Original clean latents [same shape as prediction]
        noise: Sampled noise [same shape as prediction]
        loss_mask: Optional mask for variable-length sequences [batch_size]
                   or broadcast-compatible shape. Default None (no masking).

    Returns:
        Scalar loss value (mean squared error, optionally masked).

    Example (no masking):
        >>> pred = torch.randn(2, 16, 64, 64)  # Batch of 2D latents
        >>> clean = torch.randn(2, 16, 64, 64)
        >>> noise = torch.randn(2, 16, 64, 64)
        >>> loss = compute_flow_matching_loss(pred, clean, noise)
        >>> loss.backward()

    Example (with packing/masking):
        >>> pred = torch.randn(2, 16, 64, 64)
        >>> clean = torch.randn(2, 16, 64, 64)
        >>> noise = torch.randn(2, 16, 64, 64)
        >>> mask = torch.tensor([1.0, 0.0])  # Second sample is padding
        >>> loss = compute_flow_matching_loss(pred, clean, noise, mask)
