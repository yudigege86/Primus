Noise application utilities for diffusion training.

This module provides pure functions for applying noise according to
different diffusion forward processes. All functions are stateless
and work with tensors of any shape.

Supported processes:
    - Flow Matching: Linear interpolation between clean and noise
    - DDPM: Variance-preserving noise schedule

These utilities encapsulate the mathematical formulas for the forward
diffusion process, making the code self-documenting and reusable
across different model architectures (2D images, 3D video, etc.).

    Apply noise using flow matching forward process.

    Flow matching uses a simple linear interpolation between clean
    latents and noise, controlled by the sigma parameter:

    Formula: noisy = (1 - sigma) * clean + sigma * noise

    This formulation ensures:
    - When sigma=0: noisy = clean (no noise)
    - When sigma=1: noisy = noise (pure noise)
    - Linear interpolation in between

    Args:
        clean_latents: Clean latents [any shape]
        noise: Sampled noise [same shape as clean_latents]
        sigma: Noise schedule values [broadcast compatible]
               Should be in range [0, 1]

    Returns:
        Noisy latents [same shape as clean_latents]

    Example:
        >>> clean = torch.randn(2, 16, 64, 64)
        >>> noise = torch.randn(2, 16, 64, 64)
        >>> sigma = torch.tensor([0.3, 0.7]).reshape(2, 1, 1, 1)
        >>> noisy = apply_flow_matching_noise(clean, noise, sigma)
        >>> # sigma[0]=0.3 means 30% noise, 70% clean for first sample
