"""Sequence packing for Megatron-native SFT.

Concatenates multiple short instruction-tuning samples into one fixed-length
sequence and emits per-segment ``cu_seqlens`` that are consumed by attention
kernels (``PackedSeqParams.qkv_format='thd'``) so attention does not leak across
samples. This dramatically increases real-token throughput on datasets where
the average sample is much shorter than ``max_seq_length`` (e.g. Alpaca ~80 vs
seq_length=4096 -> ~98% of FLOPs are on padding without packing).

The dataset is built offline at construction time:

    raw samples -> tokenize (no padding) -> first-fit-decreasing pack ->
    sequence buckets, each padded to max_seq_length and tagged with its
    sub-segment cu_seqlens.

Each ``__getitem__`` returns a single packed sequence so that PyTorch's
default_collate can stack ``micro_batch_size`` of them in the standard way.
``forward_step`` is responsible for stitching per-sample cu_seqlens into a
batch-global ``PackedSeqParams``.

Persistent on-disk cache
------------------------
The tokenize+bin-pack step is expensive (~71 s tokenize + ~15 s pack for
SQuAD 87599 samples at seq=2048) and used to be repeated on every rank on
every process restart, costing 13+ minutes of wall-clock in the worst case
(observed: ``train/valid/test-data-iterators-setup`` timer min=90 s /
max=783 s on run native_llama2_70b_faststart_20260513_105737).

``PackedSFTDataset.__init__`` now saves the materialized ``self._packed``
to a per-config ``.pt`` file. A hashed cache key covers every input that
affects the pack content (dataset name, split, formatter, max_seq_length,
pad_id, tokenizer identity, plus ``PACK_FORMAT_VERSION`` so a code change
forces a rebuild). Concurrent ranks serialize through a ``filelock``:
the first rank to acquire the lock builds + saves under the lock; the
remaining ranks find the file on disk and load it.

Where the cache lives:
    1. ``$PRIMUS_PACK_CACHE_DIR`` if set
    2. ``$HF_DATASETS_CACHE/primus_packed`` (default in our launcher,
       which routes to ``/workspace/cache_persist/hf_cache/datasets``)
    3. ``$HF_HOME/primus_packed``
    4. ``~/.cache/primus_packed_sft``

Disable entirely with ``PRIMUS_DISABLE_PACK_CACHE=1`` (falls back to
the old per-run rebuild path).

# A fixed cap is required so default_collate can stack cu_seqlens into

# holds ~1300 segments on average, and stopping at 256 fills only ~19% of the window with
# real tokens (10.7% supervised) while reporting a full pack. That looks like packing
# working and is really packing giving up.
#
# So scale it with the window, keeping the historical 256 for anything up to 8K. (The
