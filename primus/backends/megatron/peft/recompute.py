    """Enable grad on TransformerBlock inputs when only adapters are trainable.

    Root cause analysis:

    - Megatron's CheckpointFunction.backward() is only invoked by PyTorch autograd
      when at least one input tensor requires grad.
    - With PP>1, received tensors from other stages have requires_grad=True, so
      checkpoint backward is always called.
    - With PP=1 and frozen base model, embedding outputs have requires_grad=False.
      This means CheckpointFunction.backward() is never called, and LoRA gradients
      inside the checkpoint are never computed.

    Solution: Hook TransformerBlock.forward to ensure hidden_states.requires_grad=True
    before it enters checkpointed computation. This doesn't unfreeze any parameters;
    it just ensures the autograd machinery calls checkpoint's backward.
