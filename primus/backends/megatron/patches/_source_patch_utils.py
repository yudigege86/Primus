"""Shared helper for "source-string rewrite" style patches.

Some upstream Megatron-LM functions/methods need a small code fragment
inserted in the *middle* of their body (not just wrapped before/after), where
a plain function-wrapping monkey-patch cannot reach. For those cases Primus
falls back to: ``inspect.getsource()`` the original, apply a targeted
``str.replace()`` on a unique anchor fragment, recompile with ``exec()``, and
rebind the result onto the owning module/class.

This lives under ``primus.backends.megatron.patches`` (feature-owned) on
purpose: the shared ``primus.core.patches`` framework is inherited and must
not grow feature-specific behavior.
