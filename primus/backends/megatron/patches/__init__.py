"""
Megatron Patch Collection

This module defines the public entrypoint for applying Megatron-specific patches.

Registration vs. application (important for non-Flux / LLM users):
    Importing this package eagerly imports every ``*_patches.py`` module, which
    runs each module's ``@register_patch`` side effect. This registration is
    GLOBAL: it happens for *every* Megatron job (LLM or diffusion), because
    ``megatron_adapter`` imports this package unconditionally.

    Registration only adds a patch to the registry; it does NOT apply it. Each
    patch carries a ``condition=...`` predicate (typically gated on a config
    flag such as ``torch_compile.enable``, ``use_fsdp2_fp8_all_gather``, or a
    diffusion-specific arg) that is evaluated at ``run_patches`` time. A patch
    whose condition is False is a no-op for that job.

    Consequence: diffusion/Flux-specific patches are registered for LLM jobs but
    should not take effect there. When adding a patch, make its ``condition``
    precise so it cannot alter unrelated (e.g. non-Flux) training. An opt-in
    "patch profile" mechanism could make this stricter in the future.
