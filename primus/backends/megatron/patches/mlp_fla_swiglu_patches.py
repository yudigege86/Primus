MLP FLA SwiGLU Patch
======================

Routes ``MLP``'s gated-linear-unit activation through
flash-linear-attention's (FLA) Triton-fused ``swiglu`` kernel (one fwd + one
bwd kernel) instead of Megatron's naive two-kernel ``silu(x_glu) * x_linear``,
saving ~20 ms/iter on GDN/KDA/Mamba hybrid training.

Only takes effect for plain, unclamped SwiGLU: ``config.gated_linear_unit`` with
``F.silu``, no ``use_te_activation_func`` module slot, no
``activation_func_clamp_value`` and no ``glu_linear_offset``. ``F.silu`` on its
own is not a sufficient test -- Kimi K3 keeps that config value only to satisfy
the whitelist in ``TransformerConfig.__post_init__`` while supplying the real,
soft-clamped ``SituActivation`` through the module slot, and DeepSeek-V4 style
configs reach the eager ``glu()`` with a clamp bound. FLA's kernels implement
neither, so those configs fall through to Megatron's own code, as do GeLU-based
MLPs and MoE.

Toggle: ``args.use_fla_fused_swiglu`` (resolved by ``fla_runtime_patches.py``
from ``PRIMUS_FLA_SWIGLU`` / YAML ``use_fla_fused_swiglu``, default True).

Memory variant: ``args.use_fla_fused_swiglu_linear`` (default False) goes one
step further and fuses the activation *into* ``linear_fc2`` via FLA's
``swiglu_linear``. Megatron computes ``swiglu`` as its own op and then feeds the
result to ``linear_fc2``, which saves that ffn-wide tensor for its weight
gradient; ``swiglu_linear`` instead saves only the two fc1 halves and recomputes
the activation in the backward. That removes one ffn-wide tensor per MLP layer
(measured 0.188 GiB per unit micro-batch on GDN-300M, ffn 4096, seq 2048 -- the
entire measured activation gap vs FLA).

It is a trade, not a free win, which is why it stays off by default: recomputing
the activation costs time, and the cost grows with the micro-batch. Measured on
MI355X, 300M, seq 2048, 30 iters, median of three A/B repeats -- loss matched to
four decimals in every pair, and peak memory was bit-identical across repeats.
Both columns are deltas against the unfused path, so a positive iteration time
means the fused path is *slower* and a negative memory figure means it saves:

    model  mbs   iteration time   peak memory
    GDN      2       ~0%            -0.3 GB
    GDN     32     +4.4% slower     -5.3 GB
    KDA      2     +2.2% slower     -0.6 GB
    KDA     32     +5.1% slower     -5.8 GB

The saving tracks ~0.18 GiB per unit micro-batch, as predicted by the size of
the tensor that is no longer stashed for the fc2 weight gradient.

Correctness note: this bypasses ``linear_fc2``'s
``linear_with_grad_accumulation_and_async_allreduce``, so the fc2 weight
gradient lands in ``param.grad`` instead of being fused straight into
``param.main_grad``. That is safe -- Megatron's DDP backward post-hook folds
``param.grad`` into ``main_grad`` whenever ``grad_added_to_main_grad`` is False
-- but it does forgo the wgrad-accumulation fusion, so the path is gated to the
simple case it was measured on: TP=1, PP=1, no sequence parallel, no bias, no
per-token scaling, non-expert MLPs, no FP8 / ``delay_wgrad_compute`` /
``activation_func_fp8_input_store``, and no ``overlap_param_gather``. Everything
it bypasses lives in ``linear_fc2``: FP8 and delayed-wgrad execution inside
``TERowParallelLinear``, the deferred-wgrad enqueue the zero-bubble pipeline
schedules pop in their W phase, and the parameter all-gather hook. A PEFT
adapter can also wrap ``linear_fc2`` *after* ``__init__``, so the forward
rechecks that the module still exposes a plain ``.weight``.

Source-string rewrite style: the injection points sit inside ``MLP.__init__``
and the non-fused branch of ``MLP.forward``, which a plain wrapper cannot
reach without duplicating the whole (large) method body. The eligibility rules
themselves live in ``_resolve_fla_swiglu`` rather than in the injected string,
so they can be read and exercised as ordinary Python.
