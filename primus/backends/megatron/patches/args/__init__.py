Megatron argument patches.

This package contains one file per argument-related patch. Each module defines
exactly one ``@register_patch`` function; the implementations are identical to
the original versions in ``args_patches.py``.

The top-level ``primus.backends.megatron.patches.__init__`` uses an auto-import
mechanism that discovers all ``*_patches`` modules (including those under this
package), so simply importing this package is not required for patch
registration but is provided for convenience.
