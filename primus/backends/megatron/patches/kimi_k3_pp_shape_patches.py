"""Kimi K3 PP tensor-shape patch.

Kimi K3 replaces the ordinary ``x = x + sublayer(x)`` residual with a
softmax mixture over a *growing* set of cross-layer checkpoints, so two
tensors flow between layers -- ``(hidden_states, block_residual)`` -- while
pipeline P2P carries exactly one ``[s, b, h]`` tensor.  Inside a stage the
second tensor is an ordinary second return value threaded by the block's
python loop (``kimi_k3_block.py``); at the stage
boundary it is folded into the sequence axis by
:func:`~primus.backends.megatron.core.models.kimi_k3.kimi_k3_block._lower_res_out`
and unfolded by ``_lift_res_in`` (``kimi_k3_block.py``).  The wire
format is therefore::

    [(1 + attn_res_num_blocks_max) * s, b, h]

a 3-D tensor of **constant** shape, which is all standard PP P2P kernels
need.  ``attn_res_num_blocks_max = ceil(num_layers / attn_res_block_size)``
(``kimi_k3_transformer_config.py``); the unused slots are
zero-padded by the sender and sliced off by the receiver using
``attn_res_num_blocks_before(layer_offset, block_size)``, so no fill count
crosses the boundary.

This is the same trick DeepSeek-V4 uses for its ``hc_mult = K`` parallel
HyperConnection streams, and this module is modelled on
``deepseek_v4_pp_shape_patches.py``.  Two differences:

* V4's ``hc_mult`` is a flat build-time constant read straight off ``args``.
  K3's multiplier has to be *derived* from ``num_layers`` and
  ``attn_res_block_size``, because ``attn_res_num_blocks_max`` is a
  ``@property`` on the transformer config and no such field exists on
  ``args``.
* The condition gates on ``attn_res_block_size`` rather than on
  ``model_type`` alone.  A K3 config with ``attn_res_block_size`` unset gets
  plain residuals and an unfolded ``[s, b, h]`` wire, i.e. the stock shape --
  scaling it would break that configuration rather than fix it.

Megatron has **two** code paths that compute the PP wire shape and both need
telling:

1. The non-interleaved 1F1B schedule calls
   :func:`megatron.core.pipeline_parallel.schedules.get_tensor_shapes`
   (``schedules.py``, called for the recv and send shapes).  Both calls are
   the same, and the first/last stage suppress their unused direction inside
   ``P2PCommunicator``, so scaling every returned triple uniformly is
   correct: every P2P transfer that actually happens is stage-to-stage and
   carries the folded tensor.
2. The interleaved 1F1B / VPP schedule computes ``tensor_shape`` *inline*
   from its ``seq_length`` argument (``schedules.py``) and never calls
   ``get_tensor_shapes``.  PyTorch P2P does not validate shape, only
   ``numel * dtype_size``, so an unpatched VPP receiver would silently copy
   the first ``s * h`` elements and ``_lift_res_in`` would then reject the
   tensor with the "not divisible by 1 + attn_res_num_blocks_max" error it
   raises at ``kimi_k3_block.py``.  Scaling the kwarg on the way in
   is safe because ``seq_length`` is read for nothing else inside that
   function.

Two schedules this patch deliberately **cannot** reach, so it refuses them
instead of producing a silently wrong wire shape:
``primus.backends.megatron.core.pipeline_parallel.zerobubble.runtime`` and
``...primuspipe.pipeline_launcher`` both bind ``get_tensor_shapes`` with a
module-level ``from ... import`` (``runtime.py``, ``pipeline_launcher.py``),
which captures the *original* function object, and ``runtime.py``
additionally recomputes the shape inline.
Rebinding the ``schedules`` module attribute therefore does not affect
either.  They are selected by ``patch_zero_bubble`` / ``patch_primus_pipeline``.
